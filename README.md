# [Bortex](https://beny13.github.io/bortex/)

A stupid way to display KSH files on a web browser.

## Features

- Canvas based (is it even good?)
- Somehow works?

## Known issues

- Slam detection does not work properly
- SDVX6 curved lasers look old school

I might integrate this into something bigger, so it becomes actually usable.
